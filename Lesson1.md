## print and hello world


```
print('hello world')
print('    *')
print('   * *')
print('  *   *')
print(' *     *')
print('*********')
print()
print(3)
print(5,6,7)
print('3 + 4 =', 3+4)
```

print without newline,


```
print('first part',end='')
print('same line')
```

## Variable


```
a=1
b=2
c=a+b
a=a+1
b+=1
print(a,b,c)
```

## comments

Python comment with #. Python do not have multi-line / block comments. We can use multi-line string instead.


```
# this is comment
''' multi line
line1
line2
'''
print('hello')
```

## if statement

indent

```
a = 2
b = 3
if a < b:
    a = b
```

optional else,


```
a = 2
b = 3
if a < b:
    print('a is smaller')
else:
    print('a is larger')
```

optional elif


```
a = 2
if a == 1:
    print('a is one')
    print('one is great')
elif a == 2:
    print('a is two')
elif a == 3:
    print('a is three')
else:
    print('a is unknown')
```
